						<p class="about-text">
							I was born and raised in Phoenix, Arizona, but I now live in California.  Currently a first-year at the University of California - Berkeley, I intend to major in Computer Science and Business Administration.
						</p>
						<p class="about-text">
							I'm interested in all types of software development on many different platforms; some of my favorite languages include Java, Python, C, Javascript, and Swift/Objective-C.  For more on my programming experience, see the <a href="#experience">Experience</a> section.
						</p>
						<p class="about-text">
							I also enjoy design.  For years, I've loved making my documents and spreadsheets look stunning, and that passion for design continues to be visible today in my projects.  I'm a big fan of minimalism and the idea of simple yet elegant user interfaces.
						</p>
						<p class="about-text">
							One last thing about me: I'm obsessed with code beauty and consistency.  Although it sounds super nerdy, I believe that source code can and should look beautiful.  From lining up equals signs to maintaining the same verb tenses between comments, I believe that consistent code is beautiful code.

				<h2 class="experience-title text-left">Game Development</h2>
				<p class="experience-text text-left">
					Throughout high school, I created many plugins for a game called Minecraft.  Using the <a href="">Bukkit API</a>, I wrote and contributed to about a dozen plugins, ranging from adding Harry Potter content to the game (e.g. spells, wands, the Sorting Hat, etc) to fixing bugs present in the unmodified version of the game.  Cumulatively, my projects have received over 250,000 downloads.
				</p>  
				<p class="experience-text text-left">
					My experience as part of this community taught me the importance of open-source software and how to work collaboratively using Git.  My hard work was also recognized by the administrators of the Bukkit community, as I was chosen to join both the Developer Staff team as well as the Forum Moderation team (which were extremely small subsets of the 350,000-member community).  As part of the Dev Staff, I was required to decompile submissions and peruse the entire source for malicious or deceptive code.  The thousands of submissions that I read provided lots of experience studying <em>and understanding</em> other people's code.
				</p>

				<hr class="experience-hr">

				<h2 class="experience-title text-right">Web Design &amp; Development</h2>
				<p class="experience-text text-right">
					I have experience with both frontend design and backend development.  I love Twitter's Bootstrap framework, and regularly utilize both the CSS components as well as the Javascript modules (in fact, this website uses Bootstrap).  I believe strongly in mobile-first design and progressive enhancement.  I also have some backend development experience; I've written simple backends in PHP and Ruby on Rails.  I hope to learn node.js in a future project.
				</p>

				<hr class="experience-hr">

				<h2 class="experience-title text-left">Desktop Development &amp; Scripting</h2>
				<p class="experience-text text-left">
					I've worked fairly extensively in Java and Python to create applications and scripts that serve a variety of purposes.  I'm familiar with many of the language-specific features and have used many APIs in Java (e.g. Swing, Reflection, WolframAlpha) and Python (e.g Beautiful Soup).  I also have a fairly strong grasp of C, thanks in part to Harvard's Intro to Computer Science course, CS50.
				</p>

				<hr class="experience-hr">

				
				<h2 class="experience-title text-right">Mobile Development</h2>
				<p class="experience-text text-right">
					Mobile development is the area that excites me most because of the ease at which apps can reach millions of people.  I love Apple's new Swift language and the iOS development workflow.  I've started a handful of basic utility apps and games using SpriteKit, and I'm hoping to release one of these games in the coming months.  I haven't ventured as far into Android development, but I'm familiar with many of the general ideas behind it and have a few plans.
